Query the League of Legends API via a local passthrough express server. Builds a static front-end app via webpack.

``touch src/api/secret.js``  
-> ``module.exports = '?api_key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';``

*If I don't lose interest, I'll rework into a react app*  
**The express server isn't meant for production (front-end is, though!)**
